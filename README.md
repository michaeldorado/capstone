=========================

### Project Overview  
- Alternative fueling stations are located throughout the United States, and their availability continues to grow.
The Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC) maintains a website where you can find alternative fueling stations near you or on a route, obtain counts of alternative fueling stations by state, view maps, and more.
The dataset used for this notebook was found on data.gov, and published by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory on July 31st, 2021.
Using Time Series Forecasting, I will forecast the growth of Alternative Fuel Stations and compare to electric vehicle (EV) sales in the United States.


## Introduction
- Alternative fueling stations are located throughout the United States, and their availability continues to grow. The Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC) maintains a website where you can find alternative fueling stations near you or on a route, obtain counts of alternative fueling stations by state, view maps, and more.
The dataset used for this notebook was published by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory on July 31st, 2021.


## Problem Statement
- Many consumers are now opting for electric vehicles over gas powered vehicles when purchasing a new vehicle. However, The United States' public electric vehicle charging network must meet the demand of EV sales rapid increase. In an October 2022 survey, 46 percent of U.S. consumers mentioned the lack of public charging as one of their leading concerns regarding battery-electric vehicles.


## The Problem area
- My area of interest is AFS infrastructure growth, as well as EV market growth. I want my project to address the feasibility of purchasing an EV based on AFS growth. In other words, comprehend the growth of AFS versus the growth of EV vehicles.


## The Big Idea
- Time Series Forecasting can help measure the growth of alternative fuel stations infrastructure in the United States. Through Time Series Forecasting, consumers can make informed decisions when deciding between an electric or gas-powered vehicle purchase.

* `model`
  - In this baseline forecast chart, we can observe the model predicts AFS openings to almost duplicate by 2023.
    This is only the baseline, using entry level knowledge on forecasting.
    More advance knowledge on Time Series Forecasting will be applied for Sprint 3 using PyTorch packages.
