## Michael Dorado's Capstone
=========================

### Project Overview  
- lternative fueling stations are located throughout the United States, and their availability continues to grow.
The Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC) maintains a website where you can find alternative fueling stations near you or on a route, obtain counts of alternative fueling stations by state, view maps, and more.
The dataset used for this notebook was found on data.gov, and published by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory on July 31st, 2021.
- Using machine learning, how might we forecast the growth of electric vehicle (EV) sales in relation to the growth in alternative fuel stations infrastructure (AFS)?
## Problem Statement
- Many consumers are now opting for electric vehicles over gas powered vehicles when purchasing a new vehicle. However, The United States' public electric vehicle charging network must meet the demand of EV sales rapid increase.
- In an October 2022 survey, 46 percent of U.S. consumers mentioned the lack of public charging as one of their leading concerns regarding battery-electric vehicles.
